# cron-daemon

Useful for:

* An easy way to make background services on Linux or OS X using cron,
  and make sure it stays running.
* An easy way to run a process and automatically restart it by
  re-running the same command.

## Example with cron

Using cron, run your program `foo` like this:

``` shell
* * * * * /path/to/cron-daemon \
   /path/to/foo \
   --pid /tmp/foo.pid \
   --log /tmp/foo.log \
   --stdout /tmp/foo.stdout.log \
   --stderr /tmp/foo.stderr.log \
   -e PORT=2018 \ # optional, to pass environment variables
   --pwd /opt/foo \
   -- some arguments # optional
```

All arguments are optional apart from the program itself. But these
arguments are good for making sure that within cron your program makes
sense.

The program will be started after one minute. Every minute, cron will
run `cron-daemon` which will check whether the process is running. If
it is, it does nothing. If not, it runs it and writes its process ID
to `foo.pid`.

Because it's cron, it will ensure the program is running regularly,
and also persist through system restarts or logout.

Output in `--log foo.log` looks like:

```
INFO: Process ID 43780 not running.
INFO: Launching /usr/local/bin/finance
INFO: Arguments: ["/Users/chris/Finance/statements/"]
INFO: Environment: [("PORT","2018")]
INFO: Successfully launched PID: 44861
```
