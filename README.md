# cron-daemon

An easy way to make background services on Linux or OS X

Using cron, run your program like this:

``` shell
* * * * * /path/to/cron-daemon \
   --program /path/to/foo \
   --pid /tmp/foo.pid \
   --log /tmp/foo.log \
   --stdout /tmp/foo.stdout.log \
   --stderr /tmp/foo.stderr.log \
   -e PORT=2018 \ # optional, to pass environment variables
   --pwd /opt/foo \
   -- some arguments # optional
```

The program will be started after one minute. Every minute, cron will
run `cron-daemon` which will check whether the process is running. If
it is, it does nothing. If not, it runs it and writes its process ID
to `foo.pid`.

Because it's cron, it will ensure the program is running regularly,
and also persist through system restarts or logout.

Output in `--log foo.log` looks like:

```
INFO: Process ID 43780 not running.
INFO: Launching /usr/local/bin/finance
INFO: Arguments: ["/Users/chris/Finance/statements/"]
INFO: Environment: [("PORT","2018")]
INFO: Successfully launched PID: 44861
```
